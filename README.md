# We are planning to build a website for flood alert in a region based on rainfall data input given by users.
# We will first be using Machine Learning to get the average Rainfall in that region during past years
  After then we will  feed in the data for the current Year and check whether if this is below the Previous Year or above 
  the previous  Year .We will be creating a database for storing the information of the users we will particulary store phone number 
  and upon exceeding the level of rainfall we will inform then and guide them with safety procedures.
# The Dataset we will be using will consist of the rainfall level over the past years .
# Technologies being used
   Machine learning,Django,MySQL,css,HTML
